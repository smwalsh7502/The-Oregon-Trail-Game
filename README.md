# Title: The Oregon Trail Game
#   Dev: Samantha Walsh
# 
# Purpose:
#   In my Intro to Programming class, our instructor requested we make a project showing all of our knowledge of Python in one place. 
#   I decided to recreate the Oregon Trail Game! This game shows the basics of coding that I learned in COP 1500 which includes but is
#   not limited to: creating variables, naming variables appropriately, boolean operators, creating functions, parameters, parameter passing,
#   and arguably most imporant - readability! 
#
# Outcome:
#   The result of my project is a text based adventure game that allows the user to play "The Oregon Trail". 
#
# Problems:
#   The main issue that I ran into with this project is parameter passing with too many parameters. I think that if I had the knowledge
#   I have today of how to use object oriented programming and class objects to my advantange I could have avoided the confusion
#   of using so many parameters in each function.
