# The Oregon Trail Game

## Purpose
In my Intro to Programming class, our instructor requested we make a project showing all of our knowledge of Python in one place. I decided to recreate the Oregon Trail Game! 

## Description
The result of my project is a text based adventure game that allows the user to play "The Oregon Trail". This game shows the basics of coding that I learned in COP 1500 which includes but is not limited to: creating variables, naming variables appropriately, boolean operators, creating functions, parameters, parameter passing, and arguably most imporant - readability!
